1) The screen above doesn’t resemble that one in Figure 1, what’re missing? Write down
your findings:

   1. CSS styling
   2. header and banner

2) Study the code below, explain its logic.

    1. If a request to search a specific car has not been called yet,

    2. It will return "form1" which requires the user to input the specific 
    "Patrol Car ID".

    3. Else, it will continue to search for the car with that particular ID.


3)How does this code related to that in para 8:

    1. The code is related to para8 because this code requires the request of a form
    with the data holding the targeted "patrol car".

    2. Without the data, the code cannot query the database connected, hence the
    data can't be received or manipulated. 

4)What kind of client-side validation must you implement? Write down the code here.

    THE VALIDATION FUNCTION:
    const validate = () =>{
        let i = document.forms['form1']['patrolCarId'].value
        if(i == null || i == ''){
            alert('Please enter the Patrol Car ID to continue');
        }
    }
    PUT CODE IN FORM:
    <form action="<?php echo htmlentities($_SERVER['PHP_SELF']) ?>" method="POST" name="form1" onSubmit="return validate();">


5)What happen if user enters an invalid patrol car ID? Error!!! How to fix it?
    
    PUT CODE IN FORM:
    <form action="<?php echo htmlentities($_SERVER['PHP_SELF']) ?>" method="POST" name="form1" onSubmit="return validate();">
    
    The page will refresh with an error message alerted via the validate function;
